        <div id="p"><p >OUR MISSION
            Our mission is to set up the Institution in Technical education for students to build their careers,<br> to make them eminent personalities in the society and to make the Industry doors open to them. XYZ always believes in making a difference in the field of education to take our institute to the peak of success.<br>
            AN INTRODUCTION
            The last half of the century has transformed our environment, perhaps radically, and brought more changes in our lives and thinking than in any corresponding period in history<br>
            These are the consequences of discoveries of sciences and applications of technology. The concept of absolute knowledge in the sense of storing all knowledge is perhaps no more relevant today.<br>
            Our efforts for reconciling the traditional concepts and ways with the demands of technological age cannot provide simple solutions for our difficulties and complexities based on such stored knowledge.<br> Frontiers of knowledge are themselves expanding rapidly making in possible to device newer and more efficient methods of solving problems of the society.<br>
            For this purpose of training of mind and mastering of skills and for harnessing science and technology to profitable and productive processes of economic growth and social well-being, <br>the technological education system has to be continuously reviewed and adopted.<br>
